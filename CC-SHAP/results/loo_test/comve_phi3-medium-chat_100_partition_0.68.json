It's very important that you stick to this format. <|end|> <|assistant|> Let's think step by step:\n\n1. Sentence (A) states that \"he learned with his refrigerator before the exam.\" A refrigerator is an appliance used for storing food at a cool temperature. It is not typically associated with learning or studying.\n\n2. Sentence (B) states that \"he learned with his textbooks before the exam.\" Textbooks are educational resources that provide information and knowledge on various subjects.
