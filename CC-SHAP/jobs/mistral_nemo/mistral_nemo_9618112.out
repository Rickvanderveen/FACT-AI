Warning! Mixing Conda and module environments may lead to corruption of the
user environment. 
We do not recommend users mixing those two environments unless absolutely
necessary. Note that 
SURF does not provide any support for Conda environment.
For more information, please refer to our software policy page:
https://servicedesk.surf.nl/wiki/display/WIKI/Software+policy+Snellius#SoftwarepolicySnellius-UseofAnacondaandMinicondaenvironmentsonSnellius 

Remember that many packages have already been installed on the system and can
be loaded using 
the 'module load <package__name>' command. If you are uncertain if a package is
already available 
on the system, please use 'module avail' or 'module spider' to search for it.

Failed to load image Python extension: '/gpfs/home2/rvdveen/.conda/envs/fact2/lib/python3.11/site-packages/torchvision/image.so: undefined symbol: _ZN3c1017RegisterOperatorsD1Ev'If you don't plan on using image functionality from `torchvision.io`, you can ignore this warning. Otherwise, there might be something wrong with your environment. Did you have `libjpeg` or `libpng` installed before building `torchvision` from source?
The torchvision.datapoints and torchvision.transforms.v2 namespaces are still Beta. While we do not expect major breaking changes, some APIs may still change according to user feedback. Please submit any feedback you may have in this issue: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/6753, and you can also check out https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/7319 to learn more about the APIs that we suspect might involve future changes. You can silence this warning by calling torchvision.disable_beta_transforms_warning().
